\begin{abstract}
This section is mandatory. Your abstract is one of the things sent to
SCS for your thesis to be considered for the SCS thesis award.

An abstract is a half to one page max description of the problem you
are trying to solve, why it is relevant, the technique you are using,
and summary of results. It is beneficial to have your thesis advisor
check this, as it is the entry point to your thesis and your chance to
make readers interested.
